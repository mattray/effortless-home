Demo of using [Effortless Audit](https://github.com/chef/effortless/blob/master/examples/effortless_audit/Readme.md).

For now the source of the 3 profiles are
https://github.com/mattray/uptime-profile/
https://github.com/dev-sec/linux-patch-baseline/
https://github.com/mattray/chef_software-profile/

This needs to be updated to not wrap, but to load.
